 *
 * The player's `Added` rules set up its research, government, treasury and trade rates as they do at the start. It
 * claims a civilization and a leader, as `world/built/choose-start-tiles` does, gets its own view of `world`, and joins
 * `game.players`, so it takes its first turn from the next turn. It has no units: spawn them with the `Spawn` rules.
