# civ1-player

A repository for the `Rule`s associated with `Player` functions

This defines the core `Player`-related elements of the gameplay (including triggering `Player.takeTurn`!), with `Rule`s
that aim to recreate a close approximation of the original Civilization gameplay rules.

Use `yarn` (or rather, don't use `npm`) to install dependencies.
